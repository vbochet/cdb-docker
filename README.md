## 5.3. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (6 days)
We want to setup a continuous integration/delivery  system for our webapp with [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com). Each time we push on master we want Jenkins to retrieve the changes, compile, test on a specific environment, build and push the new image to a registry, then automatically deploy the new image on the Cloud.

### 5.3.1 Jenkins & Docker

Create two Docker images : 
- One to compile, test and package your webapp
- One for the MySQL containing you test data

The both will need to communicate so the unit tests can access to the tests data

Install and configure a Jenkins and create a job that starts the build process everytime a push is performed on master.

### 5.3.2 Your app in docker

Create two Docker images : 
- one for your webapp
- one for your MySQL in production mode 

Use DockerHub and configure your Jenkins so it pushes your images on DockerHub

### 5.3.3 Continuous Delivery
Create four Docker images: one for jenkins, one for compilation and tests, one for production (tomcat) and one for the mysql. Push them to DockerHub.

- Connect with your login to [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) 

- Create a [free account](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/free/) on Amazon Web Services.

- [Link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/getting-started/link-aws/) your Amazon Web Services account to deploy node clusters and nodes using Docker Cloudâ€™s dashboard. Be careful when choosing the type of node on Docker Cloud, select 't2.micro' under the conditions of free AWS account.

- Observe the diagram below to properly configure the architecture of Docker containers to set up the continuous delivery:
